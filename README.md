# Markdownosaur ðŸ¦–

Markdownosaur uses Apple's excellent and relatively new [Swift Markdown](https://github.com/apple/swift-markdown) library to analyze a Markdown source, and then takes that analyzed result and turns it into an `NSAttributedString` for displaying on screen on iOS, iPadOS, or Mac. It's just a few hundred lines long, and uses Apple's library's visitor pattern, so it's hopefully pretty easy to understand. :)

### Benefits

iOS 15 already [added a new initializer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsattributedstring/3796598-init) to `NSAttributedString` that takes Markdown, you should probably check if that does what you want first! Beyond that, Markdownosaur offers:

- Increased flexibility in styling the resulting `NSAttributedString`
- Support for more Markdown elements (like tables, though this requires work from the user to integrate as it's beyond the scope of `NSAttributedString`)
- Support for iOS versions earlier than 15

### Install

Using Swift Package Manager, add [Apple's Swift Markdown library](https://github.com/apple/swift-markdown) to your project. Then simply take the `Markdownosaur.swift` file and add it to your project.

(Note that this library exists more to be helpful and instructive and was quickly generalized from how I use it, you'll likely want to modify it yourself for your own specific styling for instance!)

### Usage

Simply pass in the source Markdown and then use the attributed string for whatever you'd like.

```swift
let source = "Here is some **very** cool and simple Markdown"
let document = Document.parsingRedditMarkdown(source: source)

var markdownosaur = Markdownosaur()
let attributedString = markdownosaur.attributedString(from: document)

// For instanceâ€¦
label.attributedText = attributedString
```

### Thanks

Thanks to Apple for the awesome [Swift Markdown](https://github.com/apple/swift-markdown) library, and thanks to the [Down](https://github.com/johnxnguyen/Down) library for existing which helped me figure out how to tackle some aspects.
